Created by aishwarya.chauhan75@gmail.com

This application as of now has code to find out the top N trending hashTags which are fetched after extrapolating the data provided via an input file containg several 
tweets.
This can be further extended as per the need. 

Find the top 10 trending hashtags in twitter.
Assumptions &amp; notes: 
1) A tweet is a text being input by tweeters. 
2) A main method in a java class to be implemented which takes the tweet as an input. 
3) Extract hashtags from a tweet text (Ex: sachin is hashtag in the tweet -&gt; &quot; Worlds best cricketer
is #sachin&quot;) 
4) Maintains a data structure that keeps tracking of the count of each hashtag that is coming to your main
method 
5) Prints the list of top 10 hashtags at the end of main method execution
